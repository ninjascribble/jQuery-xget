xget uses the $.get() syntax, but maintains a response cache.
Subsequent uses during a single page session won't generate another
HTTP request. Sweet.

Unlike $.get(), the callback is executed regardless of
whether or not the request was successful. The callback is *always*
executed within the document.window scope.

Usage: $.xget(url, [data,] [callback,] [dataType])
